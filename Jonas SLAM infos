#Slam Action
Works in SWARM pool so that we have 20s time after we start the action so we have time to move around the robot by hand to scan the whole table, after that the PID controller starts

set self.declare_parameter('test_with_depth', False) to True in pid_test.py file in nav_slam 
add STMcom to the slam_test.py launch file instead of nav_tools thrusters.py
